# How do I respring after applying the tweaks?
## Option 1: Use RespringApp
1. Install [RespringApp](https://github.com/jailbreakdotparty/dirtyZero/releases/download/respringapp/respringapp.ipa) using your preferred method of sideloading. If you signed RespringApp with PPQ Protection or AltStore/SideStore, enable "Change Respring App Bundle ID" in settings and type in the bundle id of RespringApp. You can find the bundle id in AltStore's/SideStore's "View App IDs" menu or with tools like [Antrag](https://github.com/khcrysalis/Antrag).
2. In dirtyZero, click the orange "Respring" button.
3. Profit 🔥

*This method brought to you by [`@nyaathea`](https://x.com/nyaathea). Due to the nature of the method, it is not possible to integrate this directly into the dirtyZero app, hence the seperate IPA. Note that you can also simply click the RespringApp application itself to respring.*

**Option 2: Display & Text Size**
1. Before applying the tweaks, go into Settings > Display & Brightness > Display Zoom
2. Pick the option that's opposite of the one you're currently using.
3. After, apply the tweaks.
4. Go back into Settings > Display & Brightness > Display Zoom
5. Pick the option that's opposite of the one you're currently using.
